My group drove to SER316 class in a brand new BMW. Then, I enjoyed a delicious Bratwurst in the Biergarten while soaking up the warm summer sun. When it became noon, I headed to my schloss where I came across the baeckerei that was selling gebaeck. Later that night, I went to the flughafen and flew to Alaska for a hund. Our flight had klimaanlage and I got to enjoy listening to rammstein along the way.
